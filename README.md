# Agent Context Graph Foundations

Canonical principles, architecture, protocol, and specification layers for Agent Context Graph (ACG).

## What's here

- principles/  
  Core principles: AAT, affordances, hypermedia, hypergraph, category theory, semiotics, policy, PROV, DI/VC, threat model.
- architecture/  
  System architecture, interfaces, and inspiration notes.
- protocol/  
  API-level protocol documentation.
- spec/  
  JSON Schema, SHACL shapes, Hydra docs, ontologies, and formal specs.

## Foundations highlighted

- Hypergraph semantics for multi-party affordances
- Category-theoretic composition of affordance workflows
- Usage-based semiotics (meaning emerges from usage)
- PROV tracing, DID/VC, and causal affordance semantics
